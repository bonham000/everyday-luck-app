# 天天吉 - Everyday Luck

》 **天天吉:** Tiāntiān jí -> _"Everyday luck"_

### An app for learning Chinese everyday.

This app uses repetitive-learning and a game-based approach to provide small, portable lessons covering the *Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi* vocabulary content. The [Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi) is a standardized Chinese proficiency tests which provides a set of vocabulary for learners to practice and learn. There are 5,000 words provided here to learn.

The goal of the app is to provide an easy and approachable way to practice learning and reviewing these words everyday. That's where the notion 天天吉 comes into play. You just need a little luck everyday to learn Chinese! The name itself also hides a clever joke, if you read "jí" differently as "jú", the name is 天天桔 - "Everyday Orange" or "Everyday Mandarin".

## App Preview

The app provides summaries of the 6 major HSK vocabulary lists for students to study and learn.

Each vocabulary list is divided into small lessons which must be completed in order. A student can chose a difficulty setting which determines how many questions are in each lesson.

More experienced students who have already master earlier content can attempt to test out of a vocabulary list by taking a summary quiz of all the content. If they pass, the next list will be unlocked!

Each lesson contains four quiz types:

* Multiple Choice English Recognition
* Multiple Choice Mandarin Recognition
* Multiple Choice Mandarin Pronunciation
* Mandarin Text Input Quiz

A student must complete all 4 quizzes with a perfect score to pass the given lesson and unlock the next lesson.

When practicing the lessons, a perfect score is required to unlock the next lesson. This can be hard sometimes... so as a student progresses through the app they earn experience points which they can use to revert any failed answers to save a quiz attempt for a perfect score.

Experience points are awarded for completing any of the lesson quizzes, but the easiest way to gain a lot of experience points is to play the **Daily Quiz Challenge** from the home screen, which will provide a random quiz of all the unlocked content so far. Passes these challenges awards the most experience points, which can then be used to pass more lessons and advance through the app more quickly!
