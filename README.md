### Mandarin [or insert language here] Learning App

---

**To get started:**

```js
// clone or fork the repo, then:
yarn install
yarn start // or expo start
```

If you're using VS Code I recommended [this TSLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint) and [this Prettier extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode).

All the source content is in the `src/Content/Source.ts` file, and may be substituted for word content in other languages. References to "mandarin", "pinyin", and "english" can then by optionally changed, if you wish.

**Todo:**

- [ ] Flashcards with Tinder pass/fail style with replay later
- [ ] App update feature
